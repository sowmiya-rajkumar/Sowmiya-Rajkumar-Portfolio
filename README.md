# My portfolio
This portfolio showcases my academic and personal data analysis projects. Here, you'll find a collection of work that demonstrates my skills in data visualization, problem-solving, and the ability to translate data into insights.

## **Project 1:** [Spatiotemporal Trends in Honey Bee Colony Loss Across the United States](https://github.com/sowmiya-rajkumar/Spatiotemporal-Trends-in-Honey-Bee-Colony-Loss-Across-the-United-States)

In this project my goal was to explore Bee Colonies dataset and analyze the trends for the below questions.

*Question:*
Does the impact of bee colony loss vary across different seasons and geographical areas within the United States? If so, how can these regions be grouped based on their characteristic bee colony loss patterns? Emphasize the findings by employing effective visualization methods.

We categorized the above question into three parts.
Part 1: Assessing Seasonal Variations in Bee Colony Loss,
Part 2: Geographical Clustering Based on Bee Colony Loss Patterns and 
Part 3: Quantifying Bee Colony Loss across US States

Line graph, dendrogram and choropleth map are used to address these questions effectively.


## **Project 2:** [A Multi-Factorial Analysis of Lemur Lifespan](https://github.com/sowmiya-rajkumar/A-Multi-Factorial-Analysis-of-Lemur-Lifespan)

The objective of this project is to investigate the relationship between the age of a lemur’s mother when she conceives and the lemur’s lifespan. We will also examine whether this relationship is affected by the number of siblings the lemur has.

For the first part of the analysis, linear regression is used to to explore the impact of maternal age at conception on lemur lifespan. And for the second part, facets from ggplot2 library is utilized to examine the relationship between lifespan and litter size for each distinct litter size group.


## **Project 3:** [Sales Report Using Tableau](https://github.com/sowmiya-rajkumar/Sales-Report-Dashboard-using-Tableau/tree/main)

Unveiling a three-year journey (2018-2020) of sales and profit trends, this project utilizes a range of data visualizations. Maps, bar charts, quadrant charts, text tables, and dual-axis charts paint a comprehensive picture. 

The analysis is then presented in a captivating dashboard and a clear narrative, making the trends readily understandable.


## **Projec 4:** [Revenue Insights Using Power BI](https://github.com/sowmiya-rajkumar/Revenue-Insights-using-Power-BI)

This project aims to analyze hotel booking data to uncover trends that will maximize revenue for the hotel.

Through data cleaning, data modeling in Power BI, and DAX measure development, I analyzed critical hotel performance metrics including:

- RevPAR (Revenue per Available Room)
- ADR (Average Daily Rate)
- Occupation %
- Realization %
- DSRN (Daily Sellable Room Nights)
- DBRN (Daily Booked Room Nights)
- DURN (Daily Utilized Room Nights)
