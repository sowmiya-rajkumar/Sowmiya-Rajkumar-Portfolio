# My portfolio
Welcome to my portfolio.
In this repository I have listed the projects that I did for my academic coursework and the projects that I did for learning purpose.

**Project1:** [Spatiotemporal Trends in Honey Bee Colony Loss Across the United States](https://github.com/sowmiya-rajkumar/Spatiotemporal-Trends-in-Honey-Bee-Colony-Loss-Across-the-United-States)
In this project my goal was to explore Bee Colonies dataset and analyze the trends for the below questions.

*Question:*
Does the impact of bee colony loss vary across different seasons and geographical areas within the United States? If so, how can these regions be grouped based on their characteristic bee colony loss patterns? Emphasize the findings by employing effective visualization methods.

We categorized the above question into three parts.
Part 1: Assessing Seasonal Variations in Bee Colony Loss,
Part 2: Geographical Clustering Based on Bee Colony Loss Patterns and 
Part 3: Quantifying Bee Colony Loss across US States
